Writing C++ code with Python 

You ever have to write repetitive code in a language like C++? Sometimes, the creative mind of an engineer can get you into trouble, and you wind up investing more time in a solution than necessary just to prove a point about how repetitive tasks can be automated. Would it have been more time efficient to simply type out the C++ and be done with it? Absolutely. Would it have been nearly as interesting as writing a Python script to do the heavy lifting for you? No way. So, given a C++ practice problem by Hacker Rank, I took matters into my own hands and did something to keep my Python sharp. Using a dictionary, a write file, and a simple loop, I produced the code that I otherwise would have painstakingly typed out line by line, not learning anything new along the way. If you are an experienced developer, this code will probably not be interesting to you. If you are an enterprising computer science student, or just someone interested in code, it could be eye-opening. 

Happy coding :)
